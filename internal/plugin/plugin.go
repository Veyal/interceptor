// Package plugin is the Phase-1 host registry for Interseptor extensions
// (see docs/product/prd-0005-extensions.md). v1 is in-process only: first-party
// packages register hooks at init/enable time. Third-party load models (UI
// slots, WASM/Starlark host) come in later phases.
//
// Hook signatures deliberately carry only IDs and small scalars — never store
// or proxy types — so extensions cannot create an import cycle and cannot stall
// the proxy hot path. Do any real work (DB reads, network, notifications) in a
// goroutine; emitters run hooks best-effort and never block forwarding.
